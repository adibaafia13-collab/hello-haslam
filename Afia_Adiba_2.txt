Question 6:
What is your process to accomplish tasks and review code?
Answer:

2. When ready, create a pull request into main.

4. If issues exist, Repo owner requests changes before merging.


Question 7:
How are you going to hold each team member accountable to stay on top of their tasks?
Answer:
Weekly stand-up meetings, a shared meetings.txt file in the repo tracking action items and deadlines, and visible GitHub commits. Each task has a responsible owner and deadline, so unfinished work is clear.

Question 8:
Set up the assignment repo per the assignment document and invite all members and ballingsclass.
Clone the repo to your disk.
Copy the file from your firstname_lastname repo, to your assignment folder.
Using commands everyone should push this file with their answers to the assignment repo after creating a branch 
called plan_lastname, and do a pull request, which the repo owner will execute.
We will check the repo to see if this is done correctly.
Don't forget to also push to your firstname_lastname repo and do a pull request.
